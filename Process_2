What we need to do is Command ->  git branch <Branch Name>
 
Command -2 > Shift the Header to another branch Command to thath is ->  git checkout <BranchName> 

Command -3 < after this all other Commits will be kept in the newly Created Branch and hence For that we need to Merge our Branch with the main Branch

and hence for that one thing that we need to keep in mind is that


new Feture New Branch , no combiantion will be made for combinning with the old branch
